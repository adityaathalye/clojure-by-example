;; EX04: Lesson Goals:
;; - We use these conveniences for good effect in API design.
;; - See how to allow the same function to support different arities,
;;   as well as a variable number of arguments
;; - See how to "de-structure" data (it's a powerful, flexible lookup mechanism)
;; - Leverage de-structuring to design a self-documenting function API


;; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;; Multiple arities
;;
;; - When we know for sure that a function must handle more than
;;   one "arity". An "arity" is the number of arguments
;;

;; - When we don't know in advance how many arguments we
;;   will have to handle, but we want to handle them all.

(comment
  ;; If we _shape_ our domain information as a data "structure",
  ;; can we use our knowledge of the shape to pull it apart;
  ;; i.e. "destructure" it?

  ;; Yes.

  ;; We use destructuring:
  ;; - In `let` bindings, to cleanly reach into data
  ;; - In function arguments, to make the API clean and expressive
  ;;
  ;; Here are a couple of commonly-used ways to do it.
  )

;; "Positional" De-structuring
;;
;; - Pull apart sequential, ordered data structures like
;;   lists, vectors, and any other sequence with linear access
;;
;; - Follow the structure of the collection, and mechanically
;;   bind values to symbols by position.


;; Evaluate and see what happens. Then form a theory of what might be going on.
(def planet-names
  (map :pname p/target-planets))


(let [[pname1 pname2] planet-names]
  (str pname1 " is the 1st planet, and "
       pname2 " is the 2nd planet."))


(let [[:as pnames]  planet-names]
  pnames)


(let [[m v e :as pnames] (map :pname p/target-planets)]
  {:useless-trivia (str e " is the third rock from the Sun.")
   :planets-names pnames})


;; "Associative" De-structuring
;;
;; - Syntax to reach into associative data structures
;;   (having key-value semantics), in arbitrary ways.
;;
;; -  Note: Clojure "Records" and vectors are associative too
;;
;; - Follow the structure of the collection, and mechanically
;;   bind values to symbols by key name.

;; Evaluate one by one and see what happens.
;; Then form a theory of what might be going on.


(let [[mercury] p/target-planets]
  (str (:pname mercury) " has mass " (:mass mercury)))


(let [[{:keys [pname mass]}] p/target-planets]
  (str pname " has mass " mass))


(let [[{:keys [pname mass] :as mercury}] p/target-planets]
  (assoc mercury
         :useless-trivia (str pname " has mass " mass)))



;; And, putting it all together, a function with a
;; more self-documented API:

(defn add-useless-trivia
  "Be Captain Obvious. Given a planet, add some self-evident trivia to it."
  [{:keys [pname mass] :as planet}]
  (assoc planet
         :useless-trivia (str pname " has mass " mass)))


(map add-useless-trivia
     p/target-planets)

#_(clojure.repl/doc add-useless-trivia)


;; EXERCISE:
;; Review the de-structured argument list in `add-useless-trivia`;
;; then try to recall and reinforce a key concept.
;; Hints:
;; - Relate it to our preferred way to model the world.
;; - What is the "world" here?
;; - What are we using to model/describe what property of what?
;;   (Yes, that's three 'what's :-)


;; EXERCISE:
;;
;; - Use de-structuring to refactor the following functions
;;   that we have copied over from ex03.
;;
;; - Develop a preliminary opinion about where and when
;;   it might makes sense to de-structure, and where and when
;;   it might not.

;; RECAP:
;;
;; - We model the world by composing data structures and then use
;;   "de-structuring" to conveniently reach into those structures.
;; - We can design function apis to accept more than one arity,
;;   and then define custom logic for each arity.
;; - When, where, and how much to de-structure is a matter of
;;   taste; a design choice. There is no One True Way.
;; - There are _many_ many ways of de-structuring.
;;   Here's a really nice post detailing it:
;;   cf. http://blog.jayfields.com/2010/07/clojure-destructuring.html
;; - Try solving 35, 36, 68, 145, 52, 156, 22, 23, 32, 30, 34, 28, 33, 40,
